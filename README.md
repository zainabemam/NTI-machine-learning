# NTI-machine-learning

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python and NumPy, as well as classification models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These implementations avoid using high-level machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`, allowing for a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work internally.

## 📂 Files Included
- **`linear_regression_implementation.ipynb`** - Implements Linear Regression from scratch.
- **`logistic_regression_implementation.ipynb`** - Implements Logistic Regression from scratch.
- **`breast_cancer_knn&svm.ipynb`** - Classifies breast cancer using KNN and SVM.
- **`heart_diseases_classification.ipynb`** - Classifies heart disease using machine learning models.

## 🚀 Implementations
### 🔹 Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight line.

### 🔹 Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that predicts the probability of a binary outcome (0 or 1) using the **sigmoid function**.

### 🔹 Breast Cancer Classification (KNN & SVM)
This notebook applies **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** to classify breast cancer cases.

### 🔹 Heart Disease Classification
This notebook implements classification models to predict heart disease based on medical data.
